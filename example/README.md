# Example Program: Using FSM and Qontak Packages

This is an example program that demonstrates how to use the FSM (Finite State Machine) and Qontak packages in Go. It includes two main examples: one for using the FSM package to create and manage a Finite State Machine, and another for interacting with the Qontak SDK using the Qontak package.

## Prerequisites

Before running the examples, make sure you have Go installed on your system.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/maskentir/qontalk.git
```

## Usage

To run the FSM example, use the following command:

```sh
go run example/example.go
```

This will execute the FSM example, demonstrating how to create and use a Finite State Machine with custom state and event types.

To run the Qontak example, you'll need to set up your Qontak credentials and configure the Qontak SDK accordingly. Please refer to the Qontak SDK documentation for more information on how to set up and authenticate with the Qontak API.
